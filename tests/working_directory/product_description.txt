The product is the StopTopple Kitchen Rack - it aims to solve the problem of awkwardly stacking different-sized kitchenwares, such as pots and pans with lids. The StopTopple Kitchen Rack is a shelf, made of powdercoated black stainless steel, that you put in your kitchen cabinets and let you stack different pots and pans without them resting atop of each other.

It comes in variants of 2, 3, and 4 layers - and the spacing can be adjusted thanks to grooves in the frame. All three have a width of 23cm and depth of 27cm - the two-layer has a 30cm height, the three-layer has a 34cm height, and the 4-layer has a 52cm height. It can also be used to store other things!
