<h3>COVID-19 Update:</h3>
<p>Due to the events relating to the COVID-19 pandemic and supply chain shocks as a result of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, there will be an expected delay of 7-10 business days in the delivery of orders. Rest assured, we are working very closely with our carriers and logistics partners to deliver the order to your doorstep in the shortest time possible, whilst adhering to all regulations and guidelines from government authorities. We seek your kind understanding and support in these difficult times.</p>
